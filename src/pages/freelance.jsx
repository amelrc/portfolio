          Selected Projects

        <br />
        <p>
          Here is a selection of projects I have worked in the past decade. As a
          self-employed designer and developer I have been fortunate to meet and
          work with very talented people. These projects require me to identify
          and build the right features for the right users. Bringing these
          products to life has allowed me to grow through the researching,
          advising, consulting of people.
